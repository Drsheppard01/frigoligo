Frigoligo is an universal [Wallabag](https://wallabag.org/) client made with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).
It is made to be _a lot of super-cool marketing things_ but for now it is just made with love and that's something.

Windows and Flatpak builds should be available in a not so far future too.
